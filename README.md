# Bootstrap-Projects---Adhoc-Sample-Company
This is a bootstrap project in which I copy the design for a simple company website.
I used this project to refresh my front-end skills. 
Bootstrap tips
1. When you get your design start top to bottom
2. Instead of coding the stuff yourself, copy and paste from the official bootstrap website, then edit it to meet your needs
3. Confirm breakpoints, make sure the website doesn't look awkward for different sizes of screen.
